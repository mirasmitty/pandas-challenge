The data analysis conducted here reveals some interesting information about the school district. Students, on average, perform better in reading than they do in math; this holds up across every high school in the district. Additionally, based on the comparison of Per Student Spending buckets and Overall Passing Percentage, more money per student does not equal a better outcome. In fact, between the four Per Student Spending buckets, students that have the least amount of money spent on them perform the best. The inverse is true as well. The more glaring difference is between success at different school sizes. Students at Large schools (2000-5000 students) perform dramatically worse than Small and Medium-sized schools. A large number of students means more stress on the system and more are likely to slip through the cracks due to less individual academic focus. Finally, fewer students are failing at Charter schools than District schools.
